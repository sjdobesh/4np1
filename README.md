# 4NP1

Pythagorean Prime Factor calculator written in Pascal.

Finds all Pythagorean Primes less than a given integer and factors them.

Pythagorean Primes are primes of the form (4 * n) + 1.

Compile: 
`fpc 4np1.pas`

Usage: 
`./4np1 > [Output File]`
or
`echo [n] | ./4np1 > [Output File]`

After launch enter a number, n, and 4np1 will calculate all primes less than n.
You can also use `echo` to pipe the number in when invoking the program to avoid this step.
